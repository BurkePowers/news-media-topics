Eric Garner's daughter: I want officers involved to face jail time

(CNN) â€“ Eric Garner's daughter wants justice, she wants to see the officer who held her father in a chokehold punished. And she does not want him to simply lose his job, or be suspended.
"I would want him to face time in jail," Erica Garner said in an interview with CNN's "The Lead with Jake Tapper."
"All the officers and even the EMS workers, because those are the people that we depend on for our health for safety," she continued.
Eric Garner, an unarmed black man, died in July after New York police Officer Daniel Pantaleo put him in a chokehold. The New York Medical Examiner ruled Garner's death a homicide, citing the cause of death as "compression of neck (chokehold), compression of chest and prone positioning during physical restraint by police."
The medical examiner also listed acute and chronic bronchial asthma, obesity and hypertensive cardiovascular disease as contributing factors in Garner's death.
Erica also has asthma. Watching the video of her father struggling to breathe left her with little doubt that not only Pantaleo's chokehold, but also officers pressing down on Garner as he lay prone on the ground contributed to his death.
"The ones that was on his back, yes, they should go to jail," she said.
Erica said she wants her father to be remembered for being family man, a great grandfather. She also called on protesters to remain peaceful.
"He wouldn't have wanted for people to go out and be angry and break stuff," she said.
"He would definitely want them to continue in a nonviolent approach to this protest," said Benjamin Lawton, Garner's cousin.
